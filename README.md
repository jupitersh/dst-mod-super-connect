# Super Connect

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Now you can connect any server directly with this mod as long as you know the `ip` and `port` of the server you want to join.

Here is the how the mod works:

You should interpret the server ip and port into `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx`.

For example, if the server ip plus port is `132.56.32.162:8979`, then you should interpret it into `132.056.032.162:08979`. After that, you just set the corret ip and port in the mod configuration page.

BTW, you can change the button name. Open the folder of this mod and locate a file named `name.txt`. Add the name you want in the first line. Reboot you game and you will find the button name changed.

**BE CAUTION:** DO NOT DELETE `name.txt`, OR THE GAME MAY CRASH!!!
